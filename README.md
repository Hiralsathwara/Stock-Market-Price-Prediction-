Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Model


Overview:


This project provides a simple web interface for predicting stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. Users input a stock symbol and specify the number of days for prediction. The application downloads historical stock data, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model, and displays both the predicted and actual prices graphically for comparison.


Features:


Web-based interface using Streamlit
LSTM model for stock price prediction
User input for stock symbol and prediction duration
Visualization of predicted and actual prices
Easy comparison for informed decision-making






Technologies Used:
Python
Streamlit
yfinance
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
NumPy
scikit-learn
